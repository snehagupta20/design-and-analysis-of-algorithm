questions that are included in the reository:

Practical 1 
Dr. Johnson has collected the blood pressure rate of a tuberculosis infected 
patient. He has stored the collected data for observing the blood pressure 
behaviour of a given patient. During the operation of the patient one of the 
doctors has asked Dr. Johnson to tell the maximum and minimum blood 
pressure of the patient.
So, this is the routine work of Dr. Johnson. So, he wishes to have a divide 
conquer based approach which takes lesser comparison to achieve the 
desire results.
Perform the following sorting algorithms-Merge sort, Quick sort, Bubble 
sort, insertion sort and selection sort.

Practical 7 
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum height of the tree.
A binary tree's maximum height is the number of nodes along the longest 
path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Practical 9 
Given a set of N jobs where each job i has a deadline and profit associated 
with it.
Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be 
scheduled at a time. We earn the profit associated with the job if and only 
if the job is completed by its deadline.
Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a 
knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item.

Implement Minimum Spanning trees: Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s 
algorithm
  Input a directed graph G = (V, E) where vertices V are represented as 
  alphabetical numbers. 
  Run the DFS-based topological ordering algorithm 
  on the graph. 
  Whenever you have a choice of vertices to explore, always 
  pick the one that is alphabetically first.
  Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. Vertices u and v are strongly connected 
  if there are u v and v u paths in G. A strongly connected component is a set 
  of vertices C ⊆ V such that u, v is strongly connected for all u, v ∈ C (and 
  no other vertices are strongly connected to a vertex u ∈ C.) 
  
  Design an 
  algorithm to identify all strongly connected components in G.

Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these 
matrices together. The efficient way is the one that involves the least 
number of multiplications.
The dimensions of the matrices are given in an array arr[] of size N (such 
that N = number of matrices + 1) where the ith matrix has the dimensions 
(arr[i-1] x arr[i]).
